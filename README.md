# AWS Migration Project

This project demonstrates the migration of on-premises infrastructure to AWS using AWS Application Migration Service (MGN), along with a step-by-step process to ensure a smooth and minimal-downtime transition.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- AWS EC2, S3, RDS, VPC, IAM, CloudFormation
- AWS MGN (Application Migration Service)
- AWS DMS (Database Migration Service)
- AWS CloudWatch, CloudTrail
- Linux (Shell Scripting, File Permissions)
- Git, Bash

## üöÄ Migration Steps

1. **Install the AWS Replication Agent** on the source server.
2. **Wait until the initial sync** is finished (approx. 1 hour after instance discovery in AWS).
3. **Launch test instances** to validate the setup.
4. **Perform acceptance tests** on the test instance. After successful validation, delete the test instance.
5. **Wait for the cutover window**.
6. **Confirm there is no lag** between the source and replication.
7. **Stop all operational services** on the source server.
8. **Launch the cutover instance**.
9. **Verify and finalize** the cutover after confirming the instance is running as expected.
10. **Archive the source server** for backup or compliance.
